# Image processing and automated detection of deficient MMR crypts to improve the Lynch Syndrome diagnosis
With a pre-existant database of intestinal crypts slides (pictures taken by a microscope), we are trying to improve the detection system relying on YOLOv3 (CNN) by designing and picking the right hyper parameters of an algorithm to identify all the crypts.
Finally, we are trying to find other criteria than the color for segmentation algorithm which detects the ACF (aberrant crypt foci) and using them for the image processing.
